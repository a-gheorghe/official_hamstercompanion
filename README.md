This repo contains code that works alongside the code in the repo rodent_repo . In this project, we created the hardware and software to track rodent running behaviour for use in a research setting.

The project consists of two apps:

The web app (this repo)
The Raspberry Pi (RPi) app (rodent_repo)

This project is hosted on heroku and can be accessed at: http://hamster-companion.herokuapp.com/
